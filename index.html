                <p>Hi! My name is Kenny. I'm a librarian working in digital publishing and digital libraries. I currently work at the <a href="https://www.library.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">University of Pennsylvania Libraries</a> as the Digital Scholarly Publishing Librarian. Prior to Penn, I worked at the <a href="https://dp.la/" target="_blank">Digital Public Library of America</a>, a non-profit digital library that aggregates metadata and thumbnails for millions of cultural heritage materials from libraries, museums and archives across the US. I previously worked at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society</a> at Harvard University. My interests include reading, soccer, video games, libraries/archives/museums/galleries, and spending time with my wife and family. I'm an alum of <a href="https://www.vassar.edu/" target="_blank">Vassar College</a> and <a href="http://www.simmons.edu/" target="_blank">Simmons University</a>.</p>

                <p>I'm currently enrolled in the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp, hence this nifty portfolio page. I've always loved fiddling with design and technology, so I'm eager to pull those interests together into a coherent technical skillset.</p>
